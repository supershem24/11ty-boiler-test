# Captain's Log, star date 7962.5

After entering a new quadrant, we were immediately met with a new sun, with a planet and a moon extremly close to it. It's suprising that UY3-I has resisted its sun's gravity to the extreme that it has. UY3-I isn't anything special, but its moon (lovingly nicknamed "Estarius" by the crew) has the interesting property of mainly consisting of water. We're suprised that a water moon can even be this close to a sun without all being gone. This is a strange quadrant to be sure.
