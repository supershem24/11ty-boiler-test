# Captain's Log, star date 7253.5

Planet Hur-VIII has many different lifeforms on it, which is suprising given its rough and barren terrain. Most life-forms are microscopic, however there are some muti-celled life-forms as well. We're interested in how they can even thrive here, but I believe that will be a job for future researchers. Hur-VIII is also pretthy mineral-rich, but it seems like it might be essential to the life-force of the planet, so we'll have to wait and see when a research team gets here.
